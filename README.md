💫 About Me:
Building real-world MERN Stack projects (React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB) to strengthen my development skills.

Beginner-friendly frontend / MERN projects, open-source contributions, and learning-based teams.

Best practices in React performance optimization, backend architecture, and interview preparation.

Advanced React (Hooks, Optimization, Routing), Redux Toolkit, and backend authentication & APIs.

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, REST APIs, and MERN project setup.

I enjoy debugging more than writing fresh code 😄 — because every bug teaches something new!
